Definition: Vitamins are organic compounds that are important for the proper functioning of the human body.

slide 2

Key Role: 
They act as coenzymes or cofactors, assisting enzymes in various biochemical reactions crucial for metabolism, growth, and overall health. 
They are bodyâ€™s builders, defenders & maintenance workers, helping it to build muscle & bone, make use of nutrients, capture & use energy and heal wounds.

Micronutrients: Vitamins are micronutrients, meaning the body needs them in small amounts (milligrams or micrograms), unlike macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) which are needed in larger quantities.

Vitamins Synthesized by the Body (Limited): 
The body can synthesize some vitamins like Vitamin D, Vitamin K2 and Vitamin B3, the amounts are often insufficient to meet daily requirements, making dietary intake crucial.
Microbes helps in the synthesis of Vitamins.
Gut health ke topic me apko bataya jata h good bacteria and bad bacteria.
It is important to restore good bacteria bcoz they help in synthesis of vitamins
when we are sick then due to medicines some good bacteria bhi destroy ho jate h bad bacteria ke sath. So probioic is important to balance the number of good bacteria.

Vitamins not Synthesized by the Body:
The vast majority of vitamins cannot be synthesized by the human body at all, or not in sufficient quantities to meet physiological needs so must be obtained through diet. These are considered essential nutrients. 
Example: All B vitamins (except for limited niacin synthesis), Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and most of Vitamin K (K1).

Slide 4:

1. Fat-Soluble Vitamins:
Types: Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K (ADEK)
Characteristics:
They are absorbed along with dietary fats and oils.
Can be stored in the body's fatty tissues and liver for extended periods.
Excess intake can lead to toxicity (hypervitaminosis) as they are not easily excreted.
Do not need to be consumed daily.

2. Water-Soluble Vitamins:
Types: All B-complex Vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12), and Vitamin C.
Characteristics:
Dissolve in water.
Are not readily stored in the body (with the exception of B12, which has some storage capacity in the liver).
Excess amounts are typically excreted in urine, making toxicity less common but still possible with very high doses.
Need to be consumed more regularly as the body's reserves are limited.
